# New interactive libraries introduced by the enhancement request.

# Library adding an interactive drag‑to‑unlock floating menu.  This behaviour
# constructs DOM elements for a key, lock and floating navigation on
# page load and decorates each menu item with its corresponding icon.
# Images are resolved relative to the theme path exposed via
# drupalSettings.mulhollandDream.themePath, allowing the theme to live
# anywhere under the Drupal root without modifying this script.  See
# js/interactive-menu.js for implementation details.
